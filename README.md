This is a KFC Drive-Through application that allows customers to place orders using voice commands. Let me break down the main components and how they work together:

Frontend (React + Vite)
Uses Material-UI for the interface
Displays menu items in a grid layout
Features a floating microphone button for voice commands
Shows order summaries and cart information
Voice Recognition (Houndify) The HoundifyService class handles voice recognition:
Initializes the Houndify client
Captures audio from the user's microphone
Converts speech to text
Provides real-time transcription updates
Handles voice responses with text-to-speech feedback
Backend (Express + PostgreSQL) The server handles:
Menu management: Stores and retrieves menu items
Cart management: Maintains session-based shopping carts
Order processing: Creates and tracks orders
Database interactions: Stores orders and menu items
Key Features
a) Voice Ordering Process:

User clicks the microphone button
Speaks their order (e.g., "I want a 21-piece bucket")
System recognizes items and adds them to cart
Provides voice feedback to confirm actions
b) Cart Management:

Uses session IDs (UUID) to track individual carts
Allows adding/removing items
Calculates total prices
Persists cart data between page refreshes
c) Order Processing:

Validates orders
Stores order details in PostgreSQL
Handles checkout process
Maintains order history
